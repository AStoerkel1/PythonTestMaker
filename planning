1. read from the file under test,
2. pick out all of the Function signatures,
3. write a new method signature to a file
    -include filler implementation
4. Write the method signature to the runner file
5. run the runner.



other things I'll need:
createTests.py
testRunner.py
    -should run all tests individually in setup-test-teardown order
wrapper methods for-
    @test:
        should print pass/fail and the assertion error
    @setup
    @teardown
